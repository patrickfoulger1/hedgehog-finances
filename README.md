## Project Description
### Introduction
Hedgehog Finances is a sleek, real-time stock tracking app built using the powerful [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) framework. The project, created as part of a JavaScript boot-camp, showcases the full-stack web development skills acquired during the course.

### Features
Designed for modern investors, Hedgehog Finances empowers users to stay informed about their favorite stocks with real-time notifications and personalized tracking features. 

### Technologies Used
#### Frontend:
- **Frameworks**: Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a React-based framework tailored for building dynamic and efficient web applications.
- **Language**: Written in TypeScript, ensuring type safety and scalability for the codebase.
- **UI Components**: Utilizes [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) components for accessible, high-quality building blocks that enhance user interface development.
- **Styling**: Styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a highly customizable utility-first CSS framework for consistent and modern design.
- **Font Optimization**: Leverages - [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a distinctive font family provided by Vercel, ensuring fast and high-quality text rendering.

#### Backend:
- **Database**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is used to store data in a scalable and flexible format.
- **ORM**: [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) enables efficient, type-safe database interaction.
- **Authentication**: [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/) handles user sign-ups, logins, and session management securely. for interacting with a database hosted on MongoDB, leveraging Firebase for user authentication.
- **Cron-Job**: We used [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org/en/) to periodically ping an **api/cron** endpoint that then triggered a user notification cascade.

#### APIs:
- [Twelve Data](https://twelvedata.com/) REST API for access to financial data.
- [Financial Modeling Prep](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/stable#dividends-company) Dividends Company API.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference) API for user sign-up, login, and session management.
- [novu](https://docs.novu.co/api-reference/overview) API for real-time Inbox and notifications.
- [web-push](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-push) for push notifications.

### Challenges and Learning
Beyond the initial learning curve of adopting TypeScript and Next.js—both of which were new technologies for our team—we faced a notable challenge in implementing cron jobs for user notifications within Vercel's serverless hosting environment. Traditional cron jobs aren't supported in serverless infrastructure, so we devised an innovative solution: creating an api/cron endpoint that is periodically pinged via [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org/en/). This triggers a notification cascade managed through [novu](https://novu.co/), enabling reliable, real-time updates for our users.


### Future Features
Unfortunately, the [Twelve Data](https://twelvedata.com/) Trial plan only provides access to US market data. Upcoming updates to Hedgehog Finances will introduce international data coverage. Additionally, users will have the ability to personalize the graphs on their dashboard, including adjusting the displayed time frame.

   - **Stock Close Graph**: Once a company is selected from the search bar, users are presented with a graph displaying the company's stock close prices over the last 25 trading hours. The graph is interactive, allowing users to hover their cursor over any point to view the precise closing value at a specific time during that period. Alongside the graph, trending information is displayed, indicating whether the stock is trending up or down and by what percentage. For additional clarity, graphs of stocks that are trending down are colored red, while those trending up are colored green.
